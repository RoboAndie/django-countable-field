to display the character, paragraph, or sentence count.

## Installation and usage
1. Install with pip
```
pip install django-countable-field
```
2. Add "countable_field" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this:
```
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'countable_field',
    ]
```
3. In the form, set the field's widget to be "CountableWidget", passing
the count type, minimum and maximum word count as additional parameters, such as:
```
    self.fields['essay_response'].widget = \
                CountableWidget(attrs={'data-count': 'words',
                                       'data-min-count': this.essay_min_length,
                                       'data-max-count': this.essay_max_length})
```
4. Include `{{ form.media }}` in your template to render the JavaScript where `form` is the name of your form context variable. If you use the [Crispy Forms](https://github.com/django-crispy-forms/django-crispy-forms) app you can skip this step - it will take care of the media element for you.

The following additional parameters are optional. `data-min-count` and `data-max-count` must be integers. 
`data-count` indicates what kind of text to count, and can be one of the following: `'words'` (default),
`'characters'`, `'paragraphs'`, or `'sentences'`.

Additional parameters:

Attribute              | Options
---------------------- | -------
`data-count`           | The type of text to be counted. Options are `'words'` (default), `'characters'`, `'paragraphs'`, or `'sentences'`.
`data-min-count`       | The minimum of the text count type that is required for this field. Must be an integer.
`data-max-count`       | The maximum of the text count type that is allowed for this field. Must be an integer that is larger than the `data-min-count` (if set).
`data-count-direction` | Whether the counter displays the current count or the allowed remaining count. Options are `'up'` (default) or `'down'`. Set to to `'down'` to display the allowed text remaining.

To run the example project, run the server using the settings file in the example_project module.
```
python manage.py runserver --settings=example_project.settings
```

I wrote a blog post to explain how I made this app. Check it out here: https://andrearobertson.com/2017/06/17/django-example-creating-a-custom-form-field-widget/
